## Welcome to my personal website!

Hi, I am Xinrui Zhan (詹昕锐). I finished my data science bachelor degree at UCSD at 2021 Winter. My undergraduate academic interest focuses on computer vision and graph neural networks. I will extend this interest to my graduate studies. Currently, I am interested in using graph neural networks to improve deep learning models’ architecture and metric learning. Contact me through my email: ctwayen@outlook.com! Below are abstracts for my projects and corresponding repos’ links. 

### Projects

- Graph Convolutional Network on 3d Points Cloud
    
    This is my senior capstone project. The project aims to train a Graph Convolutional Network predicting 3d shapes based on 3d points cloud. This project also compares the result of GCN with PointNet. Check the code here: [code](https://github.com/ctwayen/GNN-Points-Cloud) (you also can run the run.py to replicate our results). Check the project website here: [web](https://ctwayen.github.io/Graph-Neural-Network-on-3D-Points/) The code is running on a few python libraries. You can choose to run the code on the docker image we already created: [docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ctwayen/project_docker)

- American Sign Language Recognition

    This is a UCSD scholarship program. This project aims to predict the ASL signs based on video clips. The model used in this project is two-stream convolutional CNN.

- Fatigue Detection

    This project aims to detect fatigue driving based on dlib landmarks extraction and neural networks. We also applied the algorithm on raspberry pi and dragonboard to make a product in the real world. Check the code here: [code](https://github.com/ctwayen/cccfatigue)

- NYC airbnb price prediction

    This is a data mining challenge project. This project aims to predict the price of airbnb in New York City. Check the code here: [code](https://github.com/ctwayen/DSC-190-DM)
